# Email Categories

Email categories help segment your email analytics by tagging emails you send with topics you define. You do not need to create email categories from you dashboard â€” they are automatically created when you add the category via the Amply SDK.

You can view an activity feed of all engagement with a particular category, view totals segmented by activity type, and even use your tagged email categories in SQL or basic search queries.
